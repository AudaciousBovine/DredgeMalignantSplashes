- Initial Release

![Mod Description](/Images/DredgeDescription.png)
>_You sail through a dark patch in the water when your ship suddenly slows, your engine struggling to push through the viscous fluid. 
>Bubbles grow around you from the slick film and linger like tumors on the surface, 
>then one bursts near your ship with a sickening squelch and splashes onto your hull._

>_A pulsing congealed mass of dark ooze clings to your vessel, despite its ominous appearance you try to pull it off your hull.
>It's sticky body clinging malignantly to the boards... as its pulled free it finds a new host to cling to, You.
>Wrestling with the ooze it is clear it must cling to a host as it convulses into strange and shifting shapes.
>With no hope of tossing it back overboard you stuff it into a storage bin as it adheres to it's surface and lets you free._

>_It will be tomorrow's problem..._

**Dark Splashes** were an interesting addition when sailing through the **ooze** but were **too easy** to deal with, all you have to do is **discard** them making them **negligible**. 
I wanted to make them an actual _irritating_ problem clogging up your ship and _clinging malignantly_ to your hull requiring you to travel to a **shipyard** to remove them!

## Features
- :red_square:Dark Splashes can no longer be discarded
- :red_square:Dark Splashes take an hour to move on your hull (Configurable)
- :red_square:Have to be properly cleaned and removed at a shipyard (Sell for negative value) (Configurable)
- :purple_square:Dark Splashes can be stuffed in your storage at a dock to clog its space while you find a shipyard
- :green_square:There may be a shop that actually pays you for them
