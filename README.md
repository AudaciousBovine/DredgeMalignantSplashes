### Dark Splashes are more of a hazard now!

![Mod Updates](/Images/DredgeUpdates.png)
### Release 1.0.0
- Initial Release

![Mod Description](/Images/DredgeDescription.png)
Dark Splashes were an interesting addition when sailing through the ooze but were too easy to deal with, all you have to do is discard them making them negligible, I wanted to make them an actual irritating problem clogging up your ship and clinging malignantly to your hull requiring you to travel to a shipyard to remove them!

## Features
- Dark Splashes can no longer be discarded
- Have to be properly cleaned and removed at a shipyard (Sell for $0)
- OR
- Used in an Iron Rig recipe
- Morrow Shipyard now buys Materials

## Would Like To Add
- Configuration File
- Movable or not
- Removing costs money
- Extra panic rate per carried splash

## Can also be found on the Nexus! (It helps because you can leave comments there)
